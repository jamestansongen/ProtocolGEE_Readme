# ProtocolGEE_Readme

Hello, as ProtoclGEE pulls from Google Earth Engine to my local repository and to Github, I can't edit the readme there without causing an error. This repository is just for writing a readme. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/jamestansongen/ProtocolGEE or the relevant tutorials. The CASA0023 entries are not covered here as they can be read in the learning diary: https://jamestansongen.github.io/CASA0023_Learning-Diary/

**Entry 2: Night Time Lights**
